Number Guessing Game: A TypeScript-based application built with Node.js that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Players input their guesses via the command line interface, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It's a fun and interactive way to test your numerical intuition and logical deduction skills!"
